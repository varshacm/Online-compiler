Online Compiler


Cloud computing efficiently supplements for hardware and software requirements via
internet .It is thus easy to use, dynamic, virtual and scalable. Through cloud computing one
gets the feel that a web-based tool or application is installed on their own device. Hence the
users need not buy servers or any software. This paper aims to create an online Integrated
Development Environment for java language. The IDE would allow users to code, compile,
run, test and debug applications written in java. This project mainly has two objectives-
collaborative writing and centralized compiler. The IDE ensures real time collaboration with
peers. Different users may code and review the same document simultaneously. Centralized
compiler which makes use of cloud computing helps to reduce the problems of time , cost
and storage space by creating a centralized repository.

REQUIREMENTS:
•	OS: Ubuntu or Windows
•	Node js
